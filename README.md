# face-mesh-project

This project implements a real-time facial landmark detection system using OpenCV and MediaPipe in Python. It leverages MediaPipe's face mesh solution to identify and track 468 facial landmarks, providing a detailed 3D representation of the face. OpenCV is used for capturing video input and rendering the detected landmarks.

# Features

- **Detailed Facial Landmark Detection**: Tracks 468 facial landmarks for a comprehensive 3D representation.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Efficient algorithms ensure smooth and real-time processing.
- **Versatility**: Applicable in augmented reality, facial recognition, expression analysis, and more.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/CyberBoy-Mayank/face-mesh-project.git
    cd face-mesh-project
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install mediapipe
    ```

# Usage

1. Run the face mesh detection script:
    ```sh
    python face_mesh.py
    ```

2. The script will start capturing video from your in-built webcam and display the detected facial landmarks in real-time.
